I wanted to build a multi function table for some time now.
Since I plan on doing this with minimal tools - ideally only an electric planer, and in any case no router -  I had to lock onto the features I wanted.
Having seen a few of videos online I decided I want the following:
1. Moxon vise
2. T slots for guiding tools and for a possible future build of a guided router. 
3. Dog holes 22mm or 16mm (no reason for the diameter other than I have a corresponding drill bits).
4. Dog holes for use with Brio.

Materials
I got these awesome scrap timber from Travis Perkins
